<@center><b>INFORMATION</b>

You've chosen ArchiDroid's Audiophile Preset.

This profile is based on my own taste and samsung headphones. It's really hard to make such changes universal for everyone and because of that please note that overall you may or may not like my profile. Anyway it's really easy to modify it as you like by using Boeffla Sound Control and/or Awesome Beats. Still I'm sure that sound and quality are really good and you'll like it more than untouched audio profile.

Please note that every person is different, we're listening to different music, we have different taste and different headphones. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE to make universal tweak for everyone. Because of that if you for whatever reason won't like my config then please follow steps above and tweak it as you like. It's really important because I can't do it for you :). I give you powerful tool but you need to take control :).
