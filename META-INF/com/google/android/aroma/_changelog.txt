ArchiDroid 2.2.1
- [!] Added "Previous Preset" function to AROMA
# Now you can load your preset chosen during previous flashing, as long as it passes integrity check
# Please note that this function works from now onwards, so it won't load settings from 2.2.0

- Added AROMA File Manager (built-in)
# It's available under /data/media/0/clockworkmod/aromafm/aromafm.zip
# Pro tip: You can double-tap in PhilZ Touch Recovery to load aroma file manager whenever you need to do so

- Updated Yank's Kernel to 1.6g-beta4 (and Archi's config)
- Updated CM source
