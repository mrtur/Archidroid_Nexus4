ArchiDroid 2.2.1
- [!] Added "Previous Preset" function to AROMA
# Now you can load your preset chosen during previous flashing, as long as it passes integrity check
# Please note that this function works from now onwards, so it won't load settings from 2.2.0

- Added AROMA File Manager (built-in)
# It's available under /data/media/0/clockworkmod/aromafm/aromafm.zip
