- [!] Adlinux code review
# ArchiDroid's Pocket Debian has been rewritten from scratch to become more user friendly
# If you've already used APD before, I suggest to call "adlinux rebuild" in order to update, as this release also includes updated Pocket Debian
# Adlinux command is now more newbie friendly and allows even easier mounting than before
# It now takes care of things such as setting password or allowing root access by OpenSSH, to minimize required skill for using APB to the bare minimum

2. Poprawki:
- Backend is now charging-aware, i.e. doesn't execute when you charge your device in offline mode

3. ISTOTNE ZMIANY:
- Slim-mako-4.4.4.build.8.0-OFFICIAL-6939
- ArchiDroid's backend now creates a "rainbow" from LEDs during booting process # Perfect way to tell if backend has been executed properly
- Branch na Github'ie przechodzi w nazwy EXPERIMENTAL i STABLE
