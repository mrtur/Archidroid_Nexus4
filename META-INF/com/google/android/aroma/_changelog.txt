- [!] Adlinux code review
# ArchiDroid's Pocket Debian has been rewritten from scratch to become more user friendly
# If you've already used APD before, I suggest to call "adlinux rebuild" in order to update, as this release also includes updated Pocket Debian
# Adlinux command is now more newbie friendly and allows even easier mounting than before
# It now takes care of things such as setting password or allowing root access by OpenSSH, to minimize required skill for using APB to the bare minimum
